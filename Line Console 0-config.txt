
enable
conf t
line console 0
password cisco
login
exit

NOTES:
	enables 'User Access Verification' to
	login to switch from console port

	login requires a password on the line--

	# line vty 0 15
	# password blahblah
	# login
	# transport input telnet ssh

	In the above example, you could telnet to the router and login with blahblah. 
	You could not ssh to the router because ssh requires a username and password
	(which cannot be specified this way). If you eliminate the "password blahblah", 
	you will get an error that says password required but none set.
	---
	login local uses the local user database which is specified like--
	# username user password blahblah
	This will work with ssh or telnet.
